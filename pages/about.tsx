    <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold">How I got here</h2>
    <p>I wasn&apos;t always as happy and as determined with my career path.</p>
    <p>
      When I graduated college in 2015 I struggled to find a developer job. Soon
      after, I run out of money and had to get any job. I felt defeated and
      stopped writing code.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went like that till 2017 when having a job stopped being enough. I
      wanted a career. The question was, what career? The program I attended in
      college was very broad. Besides programming, I was introduced to 3D
      modeling, video editing, design and even print design. I tried treating
      all of them of work, and they were as boring as they were back in the
      college. Nothing could compare to programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to become a developer at any cost. I got back up to speed with
      JavaScript (by reading YDKJS book series and completing FCC front-end
      path) and was hired by local e-commerce startup in 2018 where I worked for
      2 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, I was a sole developer responsible for all customer facing
      websites. To help me manage it, I developed a Node.js build system that
      enabled to share core functionality, improved performance and enabled A/B
      testing. I also developed a Vue.js components library that dramatically
      shortened website design to deployment cycle.
    </p>

    <h2>Now</h2>
    <p>
      Now is an exciting time in my life. I&apos;m not a junior developer
      anymore. I&apos;m confident in my developer skills and eager to take my
      engineering skills to the next level! Senior, here I comeâ€¦ in like a
      couple years of hard work ;)
